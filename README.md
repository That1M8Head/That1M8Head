Hi, I'm Arsalan (real name), or Aeria (dev pseudonym). I'm 22 years old and I'm a game/software developer and creative author for fun.

I live in north west London, and I'm currently a student at the University of Hertfordshire.

I mainly write code in Python and Rust, but I'm also learning Haskell. Rust is my primary programming language, and Python is my secondary.

I also enjoy writing short stories and character profiles.

For creative writing, I use whatever format is most convenient at any given time, but it's usually a lightweight markup language like Markdown or a proper typesetting format like LaTeX.

My text editors of choice include Visual Studio Code, GNU Emacs and Neovim, but I'm also a text editor fanatic, so there's a lot of text editors I like messing around with.
