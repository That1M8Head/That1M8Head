<p align="center">
I'm a 20 year old boy (he/him) currently in college. I mainly use GitHub for software I make.<br>
I currently mainly program in C for my new projects, C++ or Python as fallbacks, and C# for when I'm doing .NET GUI stuff.<br>
I like messing around with computers and I've broken stuff way more times than I'd like to admit.
