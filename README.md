### ✨ Welcome! ✨
I'm a 19 year old boy (he/him) currently in college. I mostly use GitHub for side projects and experiments.

I currently mainly program in C for my new projects, though I occasionally find myself going back to C++ and Python.

I like messing around with computers and I've broken stuff way more times than I'd like to admit.

### What I'm working on
- A GZDoom mod based on Sonic [![Sonic: Lock & Load](https://github.com/That1M8Head/That1M8Head/raw/main/NextButton.png "Sonic: Lock & Load")](https://github.com/That1M8Head/Sonic-LockandLoad)
- A satirical shell made with the intention of being stupid [![Something++](https://github.com/That1M8Head/That1M8Head/raw/main/NextButton.png "Something++")](https://github.com/That1M8Head/SomethingPlusPlus) 
- A command line launcher for classic DOOM [![CmdDoomLauncher](https://github.com/That1M8Head/That1M8Head/raw/main/NextButton.png "CmdDoomLauncher")](https://github.com/That1M8Head/CmdDoomLauncher)
