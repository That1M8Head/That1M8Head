### ✨ Welcome! ✨
I'm a 19 year old boy (he/him) currently in college. I mostly use GitHub for side projects and experiments.

I currently mainly program in C for my new projects, C++ or Python as fallbacks, and C# for when I'm doing .NET GUI stuff.

I like messing around with computers and I've broken stuff way more times than I'd like to admit.
