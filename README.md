Hi, I'm Arsalan, I'm a 21-but-soon-turning-22 year old guy from the monarchy that's also a democracy for some reason commonly referred to as Britain, colloquially referred to as the land of tea.

I'm technically a software developer, but I prefer to call myself a professional computer breaker.

Here's some of my, uh... "defining traits."

+ **I write code sometimes, and do other stuff other times.** I like spending my time writing code, messing around with computers, playing games, making random edits, watching YouTube videos and sleeping.
+ **I like text editors, like, a lot.** I'm always in the market for a new text editor, from the boring, to the impressive, to the weird, to the efficient. Do I need one? No. I just like text editors a lot.
+ **I'm a game developer.** Well, uh, in a way. Technically. "DOOM modder" is a more accurate title. My main "game development" project is [Sonic: Lock & Load](https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad).
+ **I make sometimes funny videos.** And by that I mean "sometimes funny," not "sometimes videos." You can find my YouTube channel [here](https://youtube.com/@that1m8head), though that doesn't really show me doing a lot of code stuff.
+ **I'm running out of ideas.** Uhhhh. . . yeah, no. That's pretty much it. That's all I've got.

Bye!
